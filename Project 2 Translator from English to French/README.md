# Introduction
In this notebook, I have built a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. The pipeline accepts English text as input and return the French translation.

# Setup

This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently. Support is available to use either of the following two methods for accessing GPU-enabled cloud computing resources.

## Install
- Python 3
- NumPy
- TensorFlow 1.x
- Keras 2.x
