## Project Part of Speech Tagging

<<<<<<< HEAD
In this notebook, I use the [Pomegranate](https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate) library to build a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging with a [universal tagset](http://www.petrovi.de/data/universal.pdf). Hidden Markov models have been able to achieve 96.15% tag accuracy on realistic text corpora.
